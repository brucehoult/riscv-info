# JSLinux

JSLinux is an emulator written by Fabrice Bellard. It enables you to
run Linux in your web browser.

There are versions with Fedora 33 or Buildroot, console or X Windows.

Both Fedora and Buildroot have the GNU toolchain installed so you can
write and build C or assembly language programs and run them. There is
objdump to disasemble the binary code. Both include sample C and
Python programs.

Fedora of course has a lot more software included. Including emacs.

You can also download the underlying
[TinyEMU](https://bellard.org/tinyemu/) and Linux disk images and run
them on your own computer.
