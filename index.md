# Introduction

This site a guide to the world of RISC-V. As RISC-V is a work in progress,
so is the site.

I hope an everage person who does not already know computer
programming or how computers work can learn here what RISC-V is, what
it can be used for, and how to get started with RISC-V.

The goal is to be an easy to understand guide that is self-contained
and covers all topics at an easy level, with references to more
detailed and technical reference material.

# Quickly try out RISC-V

[See what RISC-V code is generated from C code?](faq/compiler_explorer.md)

[Try RISC-V Linux?](faq/JSLinux.md)

Simple [Primes benchmark](faq/primes.md) for RISC-V SBCs and other computers.

# General Information
