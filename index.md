# Introduction

This site a guide to the world of RISC-V. As RISC-V is a work in progress,
so is the site.

I hope an everage person who does not already know computer
programming or how computers work can learn here what RISC-V is, what
it can be used for, and how to get started with RISC-V.

The goal is to be an easy to understand guide that is self-contained
and covers all topics at an easy level, with references to more
detailed and technical reference material.

# Quickly try out RISC-V

See what [RISC-V code is generated from C code](faq/compiler_explorer)

Try RISC-V Linux [in your web browser](faq/JSLinux)

Simple [Primes benchmark](faq/primes) for RISC-V SBCs and other computers.

# General Information

What is RISC-V?

Why would I want to use RISC-V instead of another ISA?
