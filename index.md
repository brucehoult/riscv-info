# RISC-V Info

This site a guide to the computer ISA ([instruction set
architecture(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture))
[RISC-V](https://riscv.org/).

You can learn here what RISC-V is, what it can be used for, how to
get started with RISC-V, and how to solve common problems.

The goal is to be an easy to understand guide that is self-contained
and covers all topics at an easy level, with external links to more
detailed and technical reference material.

This site is as factual and accurate as possible, but inevitably some things
are personal opinion.

# Quickly try out RISC-V

See what [RISC-V code is generated from C code](faq/compiler_explorer)

Try RISC-V Linux [in your web browser](faq/JSLinux)

Simple [Primes benchmark](faq/primes) for RISC-V SBCs and other computers.
